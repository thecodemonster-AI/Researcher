Researcher is a lightweight, highly flexible Minecraft mod designed to pair seamlessly with the popular GameStages mod, giving modpack creators powerful tools to build immersive, stage-based progression systems.
At the core of the mod is the Research Bench, a specialized workstation that stores and displays all custom research entries defined by the pack author. Each research entry can require specific items, experience, or other conditions before it can be completed. This allows modpacks to gate content, items, or mechanics behind meaningful research steps instead of simple crafting recipes.
When a player completes a research entry, the Research Bench will output a configured reward item chosen by the creator. Modpack makers can use these items to unlock GameStages, trigger advancements, or integrate with any progression system they prefer.
For even more flexibility, Researcher also includes the Scroll, a customizable item capable of executing a command when used. Scrolls can be set to be rewarded through research or any other method. This makes it easy to automate stage unlocks, grant abilities, run scripts, or tie research completion into broader modpack systems.
